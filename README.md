Kryzstof Kudlak
Ryan Mraz
Sohan Patel 
Jacob Thrasher

Date Started: September 29, 2020
Date of Desired Completion: November 31, 2020

Vision: To provide a user-friendly, neutral site to find and review games seperate from the actual retailers and publishers.

Mission Statement: 
	The team will be working during a challenging period (COVID-19) and will continue to communicate face-to-face via Discord or any convenient substitute. Collaboration and engagement in conversations that are related to the project are important principles in our team. Each member will use their full knowledge and strengths to complement each other's weaknesses and work hard to deliver a working software.

Success Criteria:
A functional site exists where people can go to search through games which have been reviewed by peers and critics and which will provide links to various different sites where each game can be purchased. Users will be able to utilize result filters to discover new and affordable games to add to their collection.

GAMRFAX - a wiki for gamers

This project is a website created for our software engineering course at WVU. This website is a video game wiki where games are given descriptions, tagged, and reviewed. It is intended to help people find games they would want to play, and it lets these people know where they can find those games. The website is intended to be maintained by its users and admins because we would be unable to write information about every game in existence. Game entries can be added to the website and edited by users, but everything must first be approved by an admin.

Built with:
- Bootstrap
- mySQLi
- XAMPP

Features:
- Responsive design
- Dynamic webpage content
