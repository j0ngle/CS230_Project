# Includes

The includes folder has all the files that get included in headers of the main directory php files. Namely, header.php and dbhandler.php are particularly important. Header.php contains all the necessary code to create the navbar. Additionally, it has links that allow anything including it to use Bootstrap css and Bootstrap js.

The includes folder is also used by various form submissions throughout the website. Most of the files in the includes folder handle post requests sent from these forms. Data is sent through the post requests and ultimately into the database.
